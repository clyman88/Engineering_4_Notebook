# Python

## Calculator

### Assignment Description

For the calculator assignment, the goal was to create a program that, when given two numbers, would output various mathematical functions between the two numbers. The required functions were a sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo. The spicy version also required each number's factorial.

### Reflection

At first, making all of the different mathematical operations fall into the same function and have that function return different outputs caught me off guard; however, after figuring out that passing a third argument that controls what operation is returned, the task was relatively straightforward.

```python
def calc(a,b,c):
    
    #sum
    if c==0:
        return(a+b)
        
    #difference
    elif c==1:
        return(a-b)
        
print("Sum: " + calc(x, y, 0))

print("Difference: " + calc(x, y, 1))

```
I also wasn't a fan of having massive print() statements taking up multiple lines, so I made it a bit more paletteable:

```python
spice = ["Sum: ", "Difference: ", "Product: ", "Quotient: ", "Modulo: ", "First Factorial: ", "Second Factorial: "]

for i in range(0,7):
    sleep(.5)
    print(spice[i] + str(calc(num1,num2,i)))
```

This would have each output be on different lines, but without having each print statement take up a line.

## Quadratic Solver

### Assignment Description

This assignment required a program that would calculate both the number of roots of a given quadratic and the actual roots themselves. The system then prompts the user to either exit the program or input more roots.

"What the hell is a discriminant again?", my mind asks itself, vigorously rifling through crusty memories of freshman year Algebra 2 class. Luckily for it, Google is a thing.

On first glance, the assignment seemed challenging, but after doing some preliminary research and reminding myself what the quadratic formula was again for the umpteenth time in my High School career, it was pretty straightforward. I also am a big fan of making multiple small functions, instead of one or two big functions. I find it easier on the eyes to look at this:

```python
def get_input(num):
    ans = input("Please enter coefficient " + prompt[num])
    return(int(ans))

def get_discriminant(a, b, c):
    return((b**2) - (4*a*c))

def get_roots(a, b, c, root_list):
    root_list.append((-b + sqrt(get_discriminant(a,b,c)))/(2*a))
    root_list.append((-b - sqrt(get_discriminant(a,b,c)))/(2*a))
    return(root_list) #returning the list so we can print it later
```

Instead of this:

```python
def find_roots(num, a, b, c, root list):
    for i in range(3):
        ans = input("Please enter coefficient " + prompt[num])
        if i == 1:
            a = ans
        if i == 2:
            b = ans
        if i == 3:
            c = ans
    root_list.append((-b + sqrt(((b**2) - (4*a*c)))/(2*a))
    root_list.append((-b - sqrt(((b**2) - (4*a*c)))/(2*a))
    return(root_list)
```

## Strings and Loops

### Assignment Description

The assignment was to create a program that would accept an input, and then output each letter of the string one-by-one, with words being separated by "-".

For example:

```python
Input: "Hello world"

Output:

H
e
l
l
o
-
w
o
r
l
d
-
```

This was a fun one. The spicy version of this assignment was to condense the program as much as possible. The bar was 4 lines. Here's my code:

```python
word = input("Enter your word: ").replace(" ", "-").split() + ["-"]

words = [print(b) for i in range(len(word)) for b in word[i]]
```
Yes, it's an ugly piece of garbage. But it's *my* ugly piece of garbage.

The big thing for Future Cole Lyman to remember is **list comprehensions**, which is how this code is so condensed.

## Man-Shaped Pinata

### Assignment Description

This assignment required a program to written that would function as a game as hangman, where one user inputs a word and a second user must guess the word, letter by letter. 

```python
_____ _____
```

Each time a letter that is guessed is included in the first user's secret word, the location of that letter is revealed.

```python
_ello _orl_
```

Each time a letter that is guessed is **not** included in the secret word, a stick-figure starts to form under a pole.
```python
-----
    O
   /|\
   /
```

If the word is guessed, the second user wins. If the Man-Shaped Pinata is fully drawn, the first user wins.

Right off the bat, figuring out how to print out a MSP limb-by-limb was a bit of a head scratcher, but I eventually settled on this solution:

```python

incorrect_guesses = 0
pinata = ["---‚îê", "\n   o","\n  /","|", "\\", "\n  /"," \\"]

for i in range(0, (incorrect_guesses + 1)):
   print(pinata[i]) 

```

This surprised me by working correctly! Everything else was relatively straightforward, but there was one other issue that stumped me for a bit:

**Problem:**
If an input was something like "Hello world" (i.e. has more than one word), the output will be:
```python
___________
```

Instead of:
```python
_____ _____
```

This is because I have a function that affects the variable "mystery_word", which is a version of the input that is what the display is. It functions by iterating through each letter in the input, and if the letter has been guessed, it writes out the letter instead of an underscore. However, it counts spaces as letters.

**Solution:**
Before the second user even has the opportunity to guess, the program will manually run through the guessing function with " " as the input. If the input has more than one word, it will automatically substitute the underscore for the space, as that "letter" has been "guessed". All of this was put into a function which was then called whenever the user first inputs a sentence:

```python
def check_if_correct(guess, letters, output):
    correct = False
    for i in range(0, len(letters)):
        if guess.lower() == letters[i].lower():
            output[i] = guess
            correct = True
    if correct:
        return(output)
    else:
        return(False)

def spaces(letters, mystery):
    if check_if_correct(" ", letters, mystery) != False:
        mystery = check_if_correct(" ", letters, mystery)
        
```

And that's that!

# CAD

## Swing Arm:

### Assignment Description

This assignment required the creation of a Swing Arm designed from four provided drawings. The mass was then to be determined based off of what variables were used for certain measurements.

### Reflection

Getting back into CAD after taking more than a year's worth of a break took a significant amount of adjusting, especially considering that this was my first time using Onshape. Fortunately, as soon as I got started, I found the program to be intuitive and efficient, and completing this assignment (with the help of the walkthrough) was an important first step to getting CAD back into my system. The first time that I changed the dimensions of the A, B, and C variables the entire sketch definitely broke, so fixing that and dissecting the relations between lines was a good challenge to solve.

## Skateboard

### Assignment Description

This assignment required the creation of a skateboard, using the creation of multiple parts and the eventual assembly of those parts.

### Reflection

Cranking on the tunes and having one window on the instructions and the other on my Part Studio was definitely the way to go about this assignment. It reinforced a lot of the fundamentals that I learned in the prior CAD assignment, and understanding how parts are creating together and then independently joined in an assembly was an old concept that was (for me) relearned in this new program. Creating parts relative to others was a new concept that I learned using the "Use" button, and will definitely be something I need to continue to entirely understand and be able to incorporate into my future constructions. My favorite part was making the skateboard colorful. The method of creating the deck was relatively straightforward, but defining all of the other parts required more brainpower and resulted in a lot of switching between tabs. Using the revolution tool was pretty intuitive, and went relatively smoothly, and it got to the point where I would just have to read exactly what the step required (plus dimensions) and I would be able to complete it without going micro-step by micro-step.

## Duck!

### Assignment Description

This assignment required the creation of configurations of different sizes of bricks that would eventually be used to construct a duck.

### Reflection

This project was the most fun CAD assignment that I have done in a long time; something about creating Legos and building them virtually gave me an immense amount of joy. I learned a bunch about configurations, and exploding the duck I made made me equally as happy as building it in the first place. Snapping the studs into place took a little bit of practice at first, but I got the hang of it eventually. I also made a lot of other colors, because the more the merrier. I think it would be interesting to try to configure some slanted bricks...
