# Engineering 4 Notebook
Engineering is pretty cool. But, what if there were four of them?

We strive to answer that question here, and document our findings in a neat and orderly fashion.

## Calculator

### Assignment Description

For the calculator assignment, the goal was to create a program that, when given two numbers, would output various mathematical functions between the two numbers. The required functions were a sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo. The spicy version also required each number's factorial.

### Reflection

At first, making all of the different mathematical operations fall into the same function and have that function return different outputs caught me off guard; however, after figuring out that passing a third argument that controls what operation is returned, the task was relatively straightforward.

```python
def calc(a,b,c):
    
    #sum
    if c==0:
        return(a+b)
        
    #difference
    elif c==1:
        return(a-b)
        
print("Sum: " + calc(x, y, 0))

print("Difference: " + calc(x, y, 1))

```
I also wasn't a fan of having massive print() statements taking up multiple lines, so I made it a bit more paletteable:

```python
spice = ["Sum: ", "Difference: ", "Product: ", "Quotient: ", "Modulo: ", "First Factorial: ", "Second Factorial: "]

for i in range(0,7):
    sleep(.5)
    print(spice[i] + str(calc(num1,num2,i)))
```

This would have each output be on different lines, but without having each print statement take up a line.

## Quadratic Solver

### Assignment Description

This assignment required a program that would calculate both the number of roots of a given quadratic and the actual roots themselves. The system then prompts the user to either exit the program or input more roots.

"What the hell is a discriminant again?", my mind asks itself, vigorously rifling through crusty memories of freshman year Algebra 2 class. Luckily for it, Google is a thing.

On first glance, the assignment seemed challenging, but doing some preliminary research and reminding myself what the quadratic formula was again for the umpteenth time in my High School career, it was pretty straightforward. I also am a big fan of making multiple small functions, instead of one or two big functions. I find it easier on the eyes to look at this:

```python
def get_input(num):
    ans = input("Please enter coefficient " + prompt[num])
    return(int(ans))

def get_discriminant(a, b, c):
    return((b**2) - (4*a*c))

def get_roots(a, b, c, root_list):
    root_list.append((-b + sqrt(get_discriminant(a,b,c)))/(2*a))
    root_list.append((-b - sqrt(get_discriminant(a,b,c)))/(2*a))
    return(root_list) #returning the list so we can print it later
```

Instead of this:

```python
def find_roots(num, a, b, c, root list):
    for i in range(3):
        ans = input("Please enter coefficient " + prompt[num])
        if i == 1:
            a = ans
        if i == 2:
            b = ans
        if i == 3:
            c = ans
    root_list.append((-b + sqrt(((b**2) - (4*a*c)))/(2*a))
    root_list.append((-b - sqrt(((b**2) - (4*a*c)))/(2*a))
    return(root_list)
```

## Strings and Loops

### Assignment Description

The assignment was to create a program that would accept an input, and then output each letter of the string one-by-one, with words being separated by "-".

For example, an input of:

> Hello world

Would return:

>H
>e
>l
>l
>o
>-
>w
>o
>r
>l
>d
>-

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does. For code only assignments like the Python calculator, include a screenshot of the output of the code.

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here.

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
