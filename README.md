# Engineering 4 Notebook
Engineering is pretty cool. But, what if there were four of them?

We strive to answer that question here, and document our findings in a neat and orderly fashion.

## Calculator

### Assignment Description

For the calculator assignment, the goal was to create a program that, when given two numbers, would output various mathematical functions between the two numbers. The required functions were a sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo. The spicy version also required each number's factorial.

### Reflection

At first, making all of the different mathematical operations fall into the same function and have that function return different outputs caught me off guard; however, after figuring out that passing a third argument that controls what operation is returned, the task was relatively straightforward.

```python
def calc(a,b,c):
    
    #sum
    if c==0:
        return(a+b)
        
    #difference
    elif c==1:
        return(a-b)
        
end
```

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does. For code only assignments like the Python calculator, include a screenshot of the output of the code.

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here.
