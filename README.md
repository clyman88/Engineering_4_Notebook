# Engineering 4 Notebook
Engineering is pretty cool. But, what if there were four of them?

We strive to answer that question here, and document our findings in a neat and orderly fashion.

## About Cole Lyman

Cole Lyman is the definition of a rennaisance man. Boasting a staggeringly spaghetti-like frame, this 7'4 beast is ready to punch his way through
any obstacle. Lyman also has the heart of a lion, the soul of a butterfly, and the brain of Ghengis Khan (without all the bad stuff). A regular patron of the arts, 
Lyman's myriad of paintings and films (quite literally) hang over less contemporary works, such as the 'Mona Lisa' or 'Duct Tape Banana'. He's also "just a cool guy", reports everyone. 

### Early Life

Cole Lyman was born at very young age, and started learning multivariable calculus even younger.
